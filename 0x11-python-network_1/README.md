Python provides several libraries for networking tasks, allowing you to create networked applications easily. The primary libraries used for networking in Python are:

Socket: This is a low-level networking interface in Python, providing access to the BSD socket interface. It allows you to create sockets, establish connections, and send/receive data over the network. Sockets can be used for both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) communication.
