The more classes project done on 29th January 2024
In more classes and object-oriented programming section in Python, you might encounter topics such as:
Inheritance: Understanding and implementing inheritance, where a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. Which promotes code reuse and helps in building a hierarchy of classes.
Polymorphism: Exploring polymorphic behavior in Python, where different classes can be used interchangeably through a common interface, enabling flexibility and abstraction

Encapsulation: Delving deeper into encapsulation, which involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class. This enhances data security and code organization.
Special Methods (dunder methods): Learning about special methods, often denoted with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). These methods provide a way to define how objects of a class behave in specific situations.
Class Methods and Static Methods: Understanding the distinction between instance methods, class methods, and static methods. Class methods are bound to the class and can access and modify class-level attributes, while static methods are independent of the instance or class and are used for utility functions.
To go about mastering these concepts:
Read Documentation: Python's official documentation is an excellent resource for understanding the syntax and usage of advanced class features.
Practice: Write code to reinforce your understanding. Create sample classes, use inheritance, implement polymorphic behavior, and experiment with encapsulation.
