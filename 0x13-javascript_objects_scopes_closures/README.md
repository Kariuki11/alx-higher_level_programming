In JavaScript, objects are fundamental data types, and they are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or symbols) and the values can be of any data type, including other objects.

Scope in JavaScript refers to the context in which variables are declared and accessed. There are two main types of scope in JavaScript: global scope and local scope.

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
Local Scope: Variables declared within a function have local scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that function.

A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. Closures allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scopes even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows for powerful programming patterns like data encapsulation, private variables, and function factories.
