Test-driven development (TDD) is an approach where developers write tests before implementing code functionality.
The process involves:
Write Tests: Create small, specific tests outlining desired program behavior.
Run Tests: Execute tests, expecting failures initially.
Write Code: Develop the minimum code required to pass the tests.
Run Tests Again: Check if the new code passes all tests.
Refactor (if needed): Improve code structure without altering functionality.
Repeat: Iterate the process, adding more tests and code incrementally.
Benefits: TDD ensures code reliability, early issue detection, and facilitates modular and maintainable software development.
