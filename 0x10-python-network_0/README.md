Python networking refers to the use of Python programming language to develop applications that communicate over computer networks. Networking in Python involves various tasks such as creating client-server applications, sending and receiving data over sockets, working with HTTP requests and responses, implementing network protocols, and more.

Python provides several built-in modules and libraries for networking tasks, including:

1. **socket:** This module provides a low-level interface for network communication. It allows Python programs to create sockets, which are endpoints for communication between two machines over a network.

2. **http.client and urllib:** These modules are used for making HTTP requests and handling responses in Python. They provide functionalities to work with HTTP protocol, sending GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, and processing HTTP responses.

3. **socketserver:** This module simplifies the creation of network servers. It provides classes for creating various types of servers such as TCP, UDP, and Unix socket servers.

4. **asyncio:** This module provides an asynchronous framework for writing concurrent and parallel networking code. It allows Python programs to handle I/O operations asynchronously, which can lead to improved performance and scalability.

5. **requests:** Although not built-in, the `requests` library is widely used for making HTTP requests in Python. It provides a higher-level interface compared to urllib and http.client, making it easier to work with HTTP.

Python's networking capabilities make it suitable for various network-related tasks, including web development, network programming, automation, data retrieval, and more. With its rich set of libraries and ease of use, Python is a popular choice for developing networking applications.
