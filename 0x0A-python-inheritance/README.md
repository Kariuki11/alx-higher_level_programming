In Python, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the base class or parent class, and the class that inherits from it is called the derived class or child class. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and provides a way to create a hierarchy of classes.
